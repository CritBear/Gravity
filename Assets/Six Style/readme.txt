Hello Unity Developers!

After releasing my authentic medieval music pack, I was wondering what to work on next.
I've released this pack so you can get a taste for the different styles I compose in and let me know what you would like to hear on the Asset Store in the future! 

In this pack you will find 6 MP3 files in various styles:
- Black flag: this would suit games which involve piracy, ships and open sea battles during the Renaissance period.
- Car race: an electro track suited for car racing games like NFS and so forth.
- Air ship battle: an orchestral piece with metalic percussion, for steampunk games.
- Rock FPS: a heavy rock piece for first person shooters.
- Old school RPG: well, the title says it all! It would be perfect for old school RPG games (composed with the standard MIDI sound library)
- Majestic ouverture: suited for the opening of a cinematic sequence of a game in a cheerful fantasy world.

Drop a comment in the review of this Asset and let me know! :)

Thanks and enjoy!
